/**
 * 
 * Booking represents the overall "job" for a passenger getting to their
 * destination.
 * 
 * It begins with a passenger, and when the booking is commenced by the region
 * responsible for it, an available driver is allocated from dispatch. If no
 * driver is available, the booking must wait until one is. When the passenger
 * arrives at the destination, a BookingResult object is provided with the
 * overall information for the booking.
 * 
 * The Booking must track how long it takes, from the instant it is created, to
 * when the passenger arrives at their destination. This should be done using
 * Date class' getTime().
 * 
 * Booking's should have a globally unique, sequential ID, allocated on their
 * creation. This should be multi-thread friendly, allowing bookings to be
 * created from different threads.
